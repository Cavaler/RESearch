Some non-obvious aspects of RESearch usage are explained here.

- Literals like '\n' DO NOT work in plain text search! Either use regexp, or enter needed
  symbol directly using Ctrl-Q.

- '\n' and others do work in replace string even with plain-text search, UNLESS
  "[x] Use escapes in plain-text replace" is turned off.

- Single-line search in both editor and panels, both regexp and plaintext, is done
  by extracting lines from text sequentially, WITHOUT newline symbols - therefore to search for
  the word 'end' at the end of string, use regexp 'end$', not 'end\n'!

- Several-line search in editor is done by internally concatenating lines with a single '\n',
  so it is to be used instead of '\r\n' always, UNLESS you turn on "[X] Use real EOLs in editor".

- In Several/Multi-Line RegExp search from panels actual newline symbols are to be used,
  so '\r?\n' is good for most cases.

- If '[ ] Dot matches newline also' is not set, you can use '\C' as 'Absolutely any symbol,
  including newline'

- If zero-width string is found, characters surrounding it are highlighted.

- If UTF-16LE/BE or UTF-8 byte-order mark (BOM) is found in Search/Grep,
  no other encodings are tried!

- Without [ ] Use all character tables, search/grep from panel is performed:
  1. if BOM is found, that encoding is used
  2. In ANSI version, OEM codepage is used
  3. In Unicode version, codepage selected as default is used (OEM or ANSI)

- In Replace from panels, only default codepage is used.
