Some non-obvious aspects of RESearch usage are explained here.

- Literals like '\n' DO NOT work in plain text search! Either use regexp, or enter needed
symbol directly using Ctrl-Q.

- '\n' and others do work in replace string even with plain-text search.

- Single-line search in both editor and panels, both regexp and plaintext, is done
by extracting lines from text sequentially, WITHOUT newline symbols - therefore to search for
the word 'end' at the end of string, use regexp 'end$', not 'end\n'!

- Several-line search is done by internally concatenating lines with a single '\n',
so it is to be used instead of '\r\n' always.

- In Multi-Line RegExp search from panels actual newline symbols are to be used,
so '\r?\n' is good for most cases.

- If '[ ] Dot matches newline also' is not set, you can use '\C' as 'Any symbol including newline'

- If zero-width string is found, characters surrounding it are highlighted
